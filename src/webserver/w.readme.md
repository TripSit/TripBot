Welcome to TripSit's bot website!

This began because Digital ocean needs a webserver to show that the app is "ready".

So we already have a webserver running, it doesn't hurt to run some static pages

Maybe we can also do some cool stuff while we have the connection to all the bots?

Like maybe the home page can know which channel in each service is least-busy and direct new users there?
