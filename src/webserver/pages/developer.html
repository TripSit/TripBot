      Development
    </h1>
    Welcome Developers and Testers<br>
    <br>
    Our development category holds the projects we're working on.<br>
    TripSit is run by volunteers, so things may be a bit slower than your day job.<br>
    Your ability to help is only limited by much you want to contribute!<br>
    Almost all the code is open source and can be found on our GitHub: (http://github.com/tripsit)<br>
    Discussion of changes happens mostly in the public channels in this category.<br>
    If you have an idea or feedback, make a new thread: we're happy to hear all sorts of input and ideas!<br>
    We have a couple ongoing projects that can always use volunteers:<br>
    <br>

      ðŸ›¸â”‚tripcord
    </h1>
    While this discord has existed for years, TS as only started focusing on it recently.<br>
    It is still an ongoing WIP, and this channel is where we coordinate changes to the discord server!<br>
    Ideas and suggestions are always welcome, and we're always looking to improve the experience!<br>
    No coding experience is necessary to help make the discord an awesome place to be =)<br>
    <br>
    <h1 class="commandstitle">
      ðŸ¤–â”‚tripbot
    </h1>
    Our ombi-bot Tripbot has made it's way into the discord server!<br>
    This is a somewhat complex bot that is continually growing to meet the needs of TripSit.<br>
    It also can be added to other servers to provide a subset of harm reduction features to the public<br>
    This channel receives updates from github, you can watch the development in progress.<br>
    <br>
    <h1 class="commandstitle">
      ðŸ“±â”‚tripmobile
    </h1>
    Tripsit has a mobile application: (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.tripsit.mobile)<br>
    This is built on Expo, a React Native framework.<br>
    We would love react native developers to help out on this project!<br>
    We're always looking to improve the mobile experience, and we need testers to help us<br>
    This channel receives updates from github, you can watch the development in progress.<br>

      ðŸ“°â”‚wiki-contentðŸ”—
    </h1>
    We have a ton of drug information available online: (https://drugs.tripsit.me/)<br>
    New drugs are coming out all the time, EG, Delta 8 THC has become a new thing.<br>
    We're always looking to improve our substance information, and we need researchers to help us!<br>
    Researchers (see ðŸ’¯â”‚vip-welcome) use this room to discuss the content of the wiki.<br>
    If you want to make a change to the wiki, please make a new thread in this category.<br>
    Changes to the wiki will only be made after given a credible source!<br>
