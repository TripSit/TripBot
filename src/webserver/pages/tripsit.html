        <div>
            #tripsit is our main help channel and is where people who need assistance will be gently pushed.
            This room is in "thread-only" or "forum" mode so that people will see the notice posted:
        </div>
        <div>
          <img
            alt="Image"
            src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/973659526572150794/980937054445776896/1_button.png?width=400&amp;height=223"
          />
        </div>
        <div>
          Clicking this button will display a modal popup asking for information:
        </div>
        <div>
          <img
            alt="Image"
            src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/973659526572150794/980937057666994206/2_input.png?width=329&amp;height=300"
          />
        </div>
        <div>
          All of these questions are optional but are super helpful to
          have handy before alerting the team. This can also
          potentially limit people from &#8220;testing&#8221; the
          button if they know this will actually submit something.
          When ready, the user submits the modal, and the fun begins:
        </div>
        <div>
          1) The user is restricted to the Harm Reduction center so that they can't get distracted with the other channels.
        </div>
        <div>
          <img
            alt="Image"

          />
        </div>
        <div>
          2) The bot responds to the user in #tripsit with a thank you message and directs them to click on the new thread:</li>
        </div>
        <div>
          <img
            alt="Image"

          />
        </div>
        <div></div>
        <div>
           2) The bot creates a new private thread called &#8220;&lt;user&gt; chat here!&#8221; that mentions the user, tripsitters and helpers. </li>
        </div>
        <div>

          />
        </div>
        <div>
          This is a private thread: only people who are mentioned can
          see and participate. By default these are the Tripsitter and
          Helper roles This thread will also auto-archive after 24
          hours. This allows the user to follow-up the next day. After
          7 days we manually delete the thread to preserve privacy and
          clean up space.
        </div>
        <div>
          In conclusion: People who need help can click the "I need
          assistance" button in the
          <svg width="24" height="24"></svg>
          &#128519;&#9474;tripsit room. They enter their question and
          a private thread is created in
          <svg width="24" height="24"></svg>
          &#128519;&#9474;tripsit. This is a self-contained channel so
          that trolls/randoms cannot access what they're saying.
          When the user no
          longer needs help they can click a button and return to
          normal. The user has 24 hours to follow-up on the thread
          before it's archived, and we can re-use the thread for a
          week before it's deleted.
