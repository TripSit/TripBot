      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      New to discord, or want to know how TripSits discord works in detail? This
      is the page for you!
      <h2>Definitions</h2>
      Guild<br />
      What discord calls a collection of discord channels. <br />
      EG: Instead of joining an IRC server, you join a discord guild.<br />
      <br />
      Role<br />
      A set of permissions.<br />
      EG: People can be given the Moderator role, which gives them the ability
      to kick/ban users.<br />
      <br />
      Channel<br />
      Another name for a chat room.<br />
      EG: The lounge channel is a fun place to chat<br />
      <br />
      Member / User<br />
      The someone who belongs to a guild<br />
      EG: I like this member, they’re a positive influence<br />
      <br />
      Experience / Level 2 / VIP<br />
      As users talk they generate "experience points" that determine their
      “level”, just like a videogame. Different levels have different
      rewards.<br />
      See Levels<br />
      <br />
      Embed<br />
      A type of message sent by bots that allows creative formatting<br />
      EG: Normal users send messages but when i do the /about command the
      formatted message is an embed<br />
      <br />
      Ephemeral<br />
      This describes a type of message from the bot that can only be seen by the
      user who did the command.<br />
      EG: If you do /idose you will see the following message, note the final
      words that appear at the very bottom:<br />
      <br />
      Thread-only mode (forum mode)<br />
      When a channel does not allow you to type, but you can make a new thread
      to post a message that can be responded to like a normal chat room.<br />
      EG: #drug-questions room does not allow messages, but allows the user to
      click + and make a new thread to ask a question<br />

      <h1>Discord Specific Policies</h1>
      <div>
        Threads<br />
        Use the little + icon in most channels to make a temporary channel
        (thread) to discuss a topic. <br />
        This allows us to keep our thoughts organized instead of all in one big
        channel. Please use threads as much as possible!<br />
        <br />
        Text-in-voice-channels<br />
        Voice channels have a partner text channel that can be used to type
        instead of talk!<br />
        Underban<br />
        When someone is found to be under 18 they have all their roles removed,
        have their Mee6 experience reset, and have the Newbie applied.<br />
        This restricts them from seeing any channels besides the harm reduction
        center channels.<br />
        <br />
        Depending on if the user is trustworthy or not we can unban the user
        when they say they have come of age.<br />
        I want to make an age verification system >.><br />
        <br />
      </div>
      <h1>Experience</h1>
      As users talk they generate "experience points" that determine their
      “level”, just like a videogame. Different levels have different
      rewards.<br />
      Rewards for leveling up:<br />
      Level 5 - Given the VIP role<br />
      Level 10 - Given the DJ role<br />
      <br />
      <h1>Roles</h1>
      Roles<br />
      Things to know about Roles:<br />
      <br />
      Roles exist in a hierarchy so that you will gain permissions/customization
      from the highest role you have.<br />
      IE: All staff members will always have the given icon next to their
      name<br />
      EG: If you're a Moderator, you will always have a 🛡️ next to your name,
      even if you pick one of the roles that give a different icon.<br />
      <br />
      The only roles with colors are the color-roles<br />
      IE: All users can choose a color for their name<br />
      EG: As an Admin you don't need to have the Purple color, you can pick
      whatever you want to express yourself!<br />
      <br />
      Mindset roles are higher than functional roles<br />
      IE: As a user, the mindset you pick will override whatever functional role
      you have<br />
      EG: If you have the Helper role you'll have a 🐕‍🦺 next to your name, but if
      you pick the Drunk role the 🍺 will take priority. <br />
      So you will be in the 🏥│tripsit room helping people while having a drunk
      icon next to your name.<br />
      Note: This is kind of controversial, even though no one has complained
      yet. We can certainly talk about if a Helper should be able to broadcast
      that they're drunk.<br />
      <br />
      Donator roles are at the bottom:<br />
      IE: These roles don't do anything besides the icon<br />
      EG: If you've donated to the site, any of the other roles will take
      priority.<br />
      <br />

      Channels<br />
      Channels are organized by Categories<br />
      Gateway<br />
      📣│announcements <br />
      This channel will be used when we want to announce things to the general
      public. <br />
      🌟│start-here <br />
      This is where users can perform reactions to messages to get roles
      assigned to them to change their icon and color.<br />
      Kind of like on IRC how people would do Nickname|Drug, and allows them to
      choose a color<br />
      We're limited to 20 reaction roles so we can't do every drug<br />
      We can do custom emojis and make more fitting icons for each state<br />
      🤖│bot-spam <br />
      All things spammy and bot related.<br />
      It's suggested to mute this channel<br />
      This room is used to send the "level up" notifications and generally be
      noisy for bot outputs<br />
      📕│rules <br />
      This displays our rules, no messages may be sent here.<br />
      We can set up a reaction role so that people need to acknowledge the
      rules, be given a role, and then they can access the rest of the
      network.<br />
      Right now it's just a static page of rules and advice.<br />

      This channel is in "thread-only" mode so each suggestion is in a separate
      thread. <br />
      This allows us to have a clean list of suggestions and compartmentalize
      our thoughts. <br />
      Each thread is archived after 7 days of inactivity, but I believe it can
      be bumped with activity.<br />
