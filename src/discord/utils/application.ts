We do not require you to take drugs in order to help; we just need you to be familiar with the realities of them.',

      TripSit is run by volunteers, so things may be a bit slower than your day job.
      Almost all the code is open source and can be found on our GitHub: <http://github.com/tripsit>
      Discussion of changes happens mostly in the public channels in this category.

      > It is still an ongoing WIP, and this channel is where we coordinate changes to the discord server!
      > Ideas and suggestions are always welcome, and we're always looking to improve the experience!
      > No coding experience is necessary to help make the discord an awesome place to be =)

      ${channelTripbot}
      > Our ombi-bot Tripbot has made it's way into the discord server!
      > This is a somewhat complex bot that is continually growing to meet the needs of TripSit.
      > It also can be added to other servers to provide a subset of harm reduction features to the public
