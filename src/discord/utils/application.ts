      Our ${devCategory} category holds the projects we're working on.

      > **We encourage you to make a new thread whenever possible!**
      > This allows us to organize our efforts and not lose track of our thoughts!

      TripSit is run by volunteers, so things may be a bit slower than your day job.
      Almost all the code is open source and can be found on our GitHub: <http://github.com/tripsit>
      Discussion of changes happens mostly in the public channels in this category.
      If you have an idea or feedback, make a new thread: we're happy to hear all sorts of input and ideas!

      ${channelTripcord}
      > While this discord has existed for years, TS has only begun to focus on it relatively recently.
      > It is still an ongoing WIP, and this channel is where we coordinate changes to the discord server!
      > Ideas and suggestions are always welcome, and we're always looking to improve the experience!
      > No coding experience is necessary to help make the discord an awesome place to be =)

      ${channelTripbot}
      > Our homemade Tripbot has made it's way into the discord server!
      > This is a somewhat complex bot that is continually growing to meet the needs of TripSit.
      > It also can be added to other servers to provide a subset of harm reduction features to the public

      ${channelTripmobile}
      > Tripsit has a mobile application: <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.tripsit.mobile>
      > **We would love react native developers to help out on this project!**
      > We're always looking to improve the mobile experience, and we need testers to help us

      ${channelContent}
      > We have a ton of drug information available online: <https://drugs.tripsit.me>
      > We're always looking to improve our substance information, and we need researchers to help us!
      > If you want to make a change to the wiki, please make a new thread in this category.
      > *Changes to the wiki will only be made after given a credible source!*
