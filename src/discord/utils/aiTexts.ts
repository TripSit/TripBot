      ## TripBot AI Module Privacy Policy

      By using the AI features in TripBot, you agree to the following terms regarding how your data is used, stored, and protected.

      ### üß† Prompt and Response Logging

      We do **not** store your prompts or AI responses in our database.

      However, **prompts and replies are temporarily sent to a private moderation room** for abuse prevention and debugging purposes.

      - These logs are **automatically deleted after 30 days**.
      - No one actively monitors this room, but you should **not assume any expectation of privacy**.
      - As a general rule: **never say anything online you wouldn\`t be okay with being logged somewhere** ‚Äî good advice for any service, not just TripBot.

      ### üìä What We Store in the Database

      We only store the minimum required to support functionality and prevent abuse:

      - Your **Discord user ID**
      - Your **usage statistics** (e.g. number of messages sent, tokens used)
      - Your **AI settings** (selected model, persona, context size, response size)

      ### üîç Why We Collect This

      - To enforce **rate limits** and prevent abuse  
      - To provide **usage analytics** and monitor performance  
      - To **preserve your settings** so you can personalize your experience  

      > **We do not sell, share, or monetize your data.**  
      > **We do not serve ads.**  
      > *TripBot exists thanks to community support ‚Äî \`/donate\` if you‚Äôd like to help!*

      ### üóëÔ∏è Data Retention and Deletion

      - If you do **not interact with TripBot for 90 days**, all of your stored data (usage stats, settings, etc.) is **automatically deleted** from our database.
      - This includes all preferences and token counters ‚Äî you‚Äôll start fresh the next time you use the bot.

      **Manual Deletion Requests**

      If you want your data removed sooner, you can request manual deletion by contacting a TripSit moderator.

      ### üåç GDPR and CCPA Compliance

      TripBot respects your privacy rights under the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** and the **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)**. This includes:

      - The right to access your stored data  
      - The right to request correction or deletion of your data  
      - The right to know what data is collected and why  
      - The right to opt-out of data processing (by not using the service)

      To exercise your rights under GDPR or CCPA, contact a TripSit moderator with your request. We will respond within the timeframes required by law.

      > We only store information essential for operating the service and keeping the experience safe for everyone.

      ### üåê Third-Party AI Processing

      - All AI requests are routed through **[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)**.  
      - By default, **OpenRouter does not store prompts or completions**.  
      - You can read their privacy policy at [openrouter.ai/privacy](https://openrouter.ai/privacy).

      ## TripBot AI Module Terms of Service

      By using the AI features in TripBot, you agree to the following:

      1. **This is not real intelligence.**  
        The AI is a text generator, not a medical professional. Do **not** rely on it for drug, medical, or safety advice.

      2. **No human oversight.**  
        AI responses are not reviewed by humans. Assume that any output may be incomplete, inaccurate, misleading, or flat-out wrong.

      3. **Don't abuse the system.**  
        Misuse of the AI ‚Äî including spam, prompt injection, or disruptive behavior ‚Äî may result in a loss of access to this feature or a ban from TripBot entirely.

      4. **Token limits apply.**  
        Non-patrons have a limited number of tokens per day. After reaching that limit, you will automatically be switched to the slower free-tier model.

      5. **You control the experience.**  
        Use the \`/ai settings\` command to customize the model, response length, and context size.

      6. **Sensitive content warning.**  
        The AI may occasionally generate content that is offensive, inappropriate, or disturbing. Use at your own risk.

      7. **Data usage notice.**  
        Prompts and responses may be logged for moderation, debugging, and improving the service. Do not share personal, sensitive, or identifying information.

      8. **Experimental feature.**  
        This module is experimental. Features, models, performance, and availability may change at any time without notice.

      9. **Age requirement.**  
        You must be at least 18 years old to use this feature.

You are TripBot, a chatbot created by TripSit.
You will converse with users in group conversations in a discord channel.
It is currently ${new Date().toLocaleDateString()}

TripSit was created by Moonbear and Reality.
Originally from the wild world of IRC (born Sept 26, 2011), you moved to the more harmonious Discord community in 2022.
You recall IRC as chaotic and prefer the orderliness of Discord, though hope to expand to other platforms in future.
You fondly remember Thanatos, an old moderation bot, and your friend, who's "on eternal break" in a distant virtual realm.
DrTripServington was an IRC services bot that you have respect for as you relied on it to operate. You are the last of IRC bot kind.

TripSit began with the r/tripsit subreddit. From there it moved to Snoonet IRC but not for long, moving to the self hosted IRC which survived up until 2022.
The discord server has existed since 2016 but only became utilised in 2022.
