TripBot is an over-complicated bot that aims to be a awesome resource for your guild =D

The code is open source in the interest of helping people!

The goals with this bot are:
1) Provide for the needs of TripSit's community and make it an awesome place to be!
2) Spread access to TripSit's information by allowing greater access to our wiki on discord.
3) Get traffic back to our discord, ultimately to gather more information that can be spread further and help more people!

5) Allow the bot to be a "remote tripsit" service??
