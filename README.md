The goals with this bot are:

2) Spread access to TripSit's information by allowing greater access to our wiki on discord.

## Postgres stuff
Okay so moonbear is using this section to take notes on how to use postgres, cuz i have no clue what im doing

### Setup desktop programs
1) Install/run pgAdmin4
2) Create a database called tripsit
3) Create a user called tripsit with password TripSitLol123\
- If you don't use these credentials, change the env.config file

Remember that postgres is a database that runs as a webserver, so you can access it from anywhere. You can also access it from the command line, but I'm not sure how to do that yet.

### Setup project
1) Install the project (npm install)
- There is a database file called global/utils/database.ts that is used for all connections to the database
2) Run the postgres-test file to make sure everything is working! (npm run postgres-test)
